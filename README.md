# Facility Calculator for Foxhole
 A tool to help with Facilities added in the 1.0 update of the videogame [Foxhole](https://store.steampowered.com/app/505460/Foxhole/)

## Why make this?
The new facilities in Foxhole all have their own tasks with their own output timers, input resources and output products. The game is not very forgiving if you make a mistake like other games with factories are - like Factorio or Satisfactory - and planning on paper before commiting to build helps out a lot.
